## IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report: Datasets

### Dayflow: Net Delta Outflow index

Season: All

Study description: [DWR website](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services/Compliance-Monitoring-And-Assessment/Dayflow-Data)

Data location: [CNRA portal](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dayflow)

Data format: comma delimited files (.csv)

Range: 1929-present

Notes: For now, this is just a file generated by hand.


### Environmental Monitoring Program (DWR): Temperature, NO3-/NO2-/NH4+, Turbidity, Chlorophyll-a, Secchi Depth 

Season: All

Study description: [Bay-Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11285)

Data location: [Bay-Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11285) 

Data format: Microsoft Excel files (.xls)

Range: 1979-present

Notes: For now, these data have to be downloaded by hand.

### Zooplankton Survey (CDFW): Zooplankton

Season: All

Study description: [Bay Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11281)

Data location: [CDFW FTP site](ftp://ftp.dfg.ca.gov/IEP_Zooplankton) OR [Bay-Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11281)

Data format: Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx)

Range: 1979-present

Primary Data File(s): 

* 1972-2018CBMatrix.xlsx (tab = CB CPUE Matrix 1972-2018)
* 1972-2018PumpMatrix.xlsx (tab = Pump CPUE Matrix 1972-2018)
* 1972-2018MysidMatrix.xlsx (tab = Mysid CPUE Matrix 1972-2018)

Supporting Data File(s): 1972-2017MysidMatrix.xlsx (tab = StationLookup)

Notes: CPUE is available for all three sampling types (CB, Mysid, Pump) but not the BPUE or even the taxon-specific biomass estimates. I could ask April to add that info to the FTP site. In the meantime, I do have files for this. StationLookup is needed because the GPS coordinates for stations are needed to group stations into geographic regions. The StationLookup from the Mysid Net dataset works best because the StationLookup datasets for the other two surveys are just subsets of this one.

For SacPAS [Red Bluff Juvenile Estimates Daily Table Query with Biweekly Totals](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/sacramento/data/query_redbluff_daily.html)

This is the call to generate the CSV file only of the calendar year based Red Bluff daily passage estimates. In this call, the biweekly estimates are turned off and water temperature unit is the default, Celsius. You would replace year value to query for different years. We have 2004 to present in the SacPAS database.
