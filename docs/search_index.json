The IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report presents the full time series for selected water quality, plankton, and fisheries surveys conducted by IEP in a single graphical report. The report is generated on a quarterly basis, with different set of ecosystem variables and surveys highlighted in each season. The report is developed by IEP scientists (including leads for monitoring surveys and the IEP Lead Scientist) and is reviewed by the IEP Science Management Team and Coordinators before online publication.

Delta Outflow Figure 2: mean is represented by a dotted red line Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Spring flow is driven primarily by rainfall, snowmelt, and upstream dam releases. The spring of 2020 had lower outflow than average. Spring Secchi Depth Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWRs Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

Spring Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWRs Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986  especially in Suisun Bay.

Spring Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer.

Available on request: iepnewsletter@water.ca.gov Recent Trends: Spring Fish 2004-2020 Background Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The CDFW 20mm Survey was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWSs Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Microcystis is a toxic cyanobacteria first found in the Delta in 1998. Microcystis presence has been documented by the Environmental Monitoring Program and the CDFW Summer Townet Survey during their water quality sampling. Aquatic vegetation in the Delta has increased significantly in recent years. This vegetation is composed mostly of non-native invasive plant species and is categorized as either floating or submerged types. Coverage is estimated by UC-Davis using remote sensing of the North and Central Delta.

Indices for many pelagic fishes are at record lows, including Delta and Longfin Smelt which are protected by California and/or federal Endangered Species Acts. White Sturgeon is a species of concern and a popular target of recreational fishing. Catch per unit effort is based on trammel net surveys. Fall Run Chinook Salmon, an important species for both the commercial and recreational fishery, is also a species of concern. Population dynamics are driven by hatchery production and a suite of environmental variables. Totals counts of both in-river and hatchery returns are shown here.

The winter of 2020 includes December of 2019, January and February of 2020. Winter Delta Outflow Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Winter flow is driven primarily by rainfall and upstream dam releases. The winter of 2020 had lower than average outflow. Winter Secchi Depth Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWRs Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Winter Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWRs Environmental Monitoring Program. Productivity, fish growth, and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing winter temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction and allow invasive aquatic plants to survive the winter. Winter temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

Winter Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the winter. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWRs Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986  especially in Suisun Bay.

Available on request: iepnewsletter@water.ca.gov Winter Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling during the winter did not begin until 1995. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in winter tends to be the lowest of the year.

The CDFW Spring Kodiak Trawl was designed to sample spawning Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so are better sampled by the CDFW Bay Study. The Bay Study samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta.

The IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report presents the full time series for selected water quality, plankton, and fisheries surveys conducted by IEP in a single graphical report. While the report is not a comprehensive view of all the data collected by IEP, it is intended to provide a general overview of the longevity and breadth of IEP survey work. A major goal of this report is to illustrate the scope of IEP surveys and emerging trends in the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem to the public, potential science collaborators, and IEP and other resource agency managers and directors. The report is generated on a quarterly basis, with different set of ecosystem variables and surveys highlighted in each season. The report is developed by IEP scientists (including leads for monitoring surveys and the IEP Lead Scientist) and is reviewed by the IEP Science Management Team and Coordinators before online publication. General Information Season Definitions This report covers a suite of key IEP data sets relevant each season.For data sets collected throughout the year, such as water temperature, we only used data from this three-month period to generate graphs. For data sets that are season-specific, we include the entire sampling period, even if it does not overlap exactly with our season definition (for example, the 20mm Survey index includes data from March-July, whereas the spring season is defined as March-May). Spring = March to May Summer = June to August, Fall = September to November, and Winter = December to February, with January and February included with December of the previous year Geographic Region Definitions Many of the data sets in the report are represented by a panel of three plots, one for each of three geographic regions: San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This subdivision of data sets is designed to facilitate comparison among major regions that differ in a variety of characteristics. San Pablo Bay includes data collected east of Point San Pablo and west of the Carquinez Straight. Suisun Bay includes data collected east of the Carquinez Straight and west of the town of Collinsville. The Delta includes data east of Collinsville. Data sets are represented as a single graph when the data are only collected within a single region (e.g., Net Delta Outflow) and for wide-ranging organisms that frequent multiple regions (e.g., Delta Smelt). Figure 157: Map of the estuary with circles around San Pablo Bay, Suisun, and the Delta Figure 1. Map of geographic regions of the Estuary. Year Ranges Most of the graphs in the report have an x-axis range from 1966 to 2018. This start year was selected because it is the year of initiation for the Fall Midwater Trawl survey, one of the longest-running surveys. Standardizing the year range on the x-axis facilitates visual comparison across data sets. The entire time series for nearly all data sets fits within this time range. Data sets that started before 1966 were truncated in this report, for purposes of consistency within the report. The graphs in the Recent Trends section of the report range from 2004 to 2018. Calculations for Data Points The points plotted on the graphs represent mean values. Means are generated by averaging data over the three months of the season for a given year and across sites within a given region where relevant (e.g., water quality and plankton data sets). The dotted horizontal line indicates the average value over the entire period of record. Data Sets Flow (All Seasons) Data Source: Department of Water Resources, Environmental Planning and Information Branch Metric Used: Net Delta Outflow Index, which is estimated using a summation of river inflows, precipitation, agricultural consumptive demand, and project exports. Dayflow is computed once per year following the start of the new water year (October 1). At that time official QA/QCd data is requested from several water quality monitoring stations. Once all input data is received, Dayflow estimate of Delta outflow is computed. The Dayflow estimate of Delta outflow is referred to as the net Delta outflow index (NDOI) because it does not an account for tidal flows, the fortnight lunar fill-drain cycle of the estuary, or barometric pressure changes. It is a quantity that never actually occurs in real time. Rather, it is an estimate of the net difference between ebbing and flooding tidal flows at Chipps Island (~ + / - 150,000 cfs), aliased to a daily average. Depending on conditions, the actual net Delta outflow for a given day can be much higher or lower than the Dayflow estimate. Dayflow Net Delta Outflow vs Net Delta Outflow Index provides an example comparison of Dayflow output with measured daily average outflow. Year Range: 1966-2018. The entire data set includes 1929-2019 but was truncated to conform to the year range of the rest of the data sets in the report.

The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) Zooplankton Study (also known as the IEP Zooplankton Study) began in 1972 in order to assess trends in fish food resources ranging from San Pablo Bay to the east Delta, as well as to detect and assess the impacts of recently introduced zooplankton species on native species. The study is mandated by Water Right Decision 1641 for operation of the State Water Project and Central Valley Project. The EMP study is conducted by CDFW in collaboration with DWR, and the US Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and currently samples 17 fixed stations and 2 floating entrapment zone stations (locations where the bottom salinity is 2 and 6 PPT). There are also 3 additional stations located in Carquinez Strait and San Pablo Bay, which are sampled during periods of high outflow and low salinity. Historically (prior to 1995) the survey sampled at a much larger number of stations. Zooplankton for EMP are sampled in 3 different size ranges: microzooplankton, including most cyclopoid copepods, are sampled using a pump, mesozooplankton, including most cladocera and calanoid copepdos, are sampled using a modified Clarke-Bumpus net, and macrozooplankton, including mysids are sampled using a mysid net. All EMP zooplankton are collected monthly at fixed stations year-round in open channels at high slack tide and preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Macrozooplankton and Mesozooplankton are collected using 10-minute oblique tows with a 124 cm long net with 505 µm mesh, and a 73 cm long net with 160 µm mesh, respectively. Both nets have a General Oceanics mechanical flowmeter attached to meaure volume sampled. Prior to 1974, macrozooplankton were sampled with a 930 µm mesh net. Microzooplankton are collected with a Teel marine pump while the intake hose is raised through the water column and pumped into a net with 43 µm mesh. Pump samples collected approximately 1.5 - 1.9 L from 1972  2007, and 75 L from 2008 - present, measured by a digital flowmeter connected to the hose. Organisms in these samples are identified and counted by taxonomists at the CDFW laboratory. Mysids are also measured to the nearest millimeter. Biomass of cyclopoid copepods, calanoid copepods, and cladocera is calculated by multiplying catch-per-unit-effort by average biomass for each taxa. Biomass of mysids is calculated using length-weight regressions. Year Range: 1975  2018 Note: Winter sampling did not begin until 1995 Stations by Region San Pablo: Stations = 2, years: 1998-2018. Note: One station sampled consistently since 1998 and the other one since 2003. Suisun: Stations = 6, years: 1975-2018 Delta: Stations = 8, years: 1975-2018 Additional Information:https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Zooplankton-Study Data is also published on the Environmental Data Initiative Website Juvenile Winter-run Run Chinook: Chipps Island Trawl (Winter and Spring Reports) Data Source: US Fish and Wildlife Service, Lodi Field Office, Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program Metric Used: Mean catch per unit effort estimates for Winter-run Chinook. The calculation method is similar to that used by DJFMP staff for reporting. The Chipps Island Trawl is a midwater trawl that targets juvenile salmonids and operates three days per week, ten tows per day, throughout the year. During each sampling day, staff attempted ten 20-minute tows between approximately 7am and 1pm, though night sampling did take place in some historical years. Tows were generally conducted facing into the direction of flow (either upstream or downstream, depending on tide). The reach length is approximately 4 km. The measure of the distance traveled during each tow was recorded using a calibrated mechanical flow meter (General Oceanics, Model #2030) deployed alongside the boat. Staff identify all fish in each sample that were  25 mm fork length (FL) to species or race and measure fish to the nearest 1 mm FL. If greater than 50 individuals of a Chinook Salmon race, as designated by the river length-at-capture-date criteria, or other species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are captured, a subsample of 50 individuals is randomly measured for FL and the rest are counted and not measured. For non-listed species, if greater than 30 individuals of a non-listed species are captured, a subsample of 30 individuals is randomly measured for FL and the rest are counted and not measured. Fish that could not be accurately identified in the field are preserved and brought back to the laboratory. The identification of preserved fishes is then confirmed with the use of dichotomous keys and/or with the aid of a microscope. The race of all unmarked juvenile Chinook Salmon (i.e., no adipose fin clip to indicate that it is a hatchery fish) was determined using the river LDC developed by Fisher (1992) and modified by Greene (1992). The LDC is currently widely used by managers, and is the only cost effective and logistically feasible way to differentiate between the different races of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the field. However, many of the Chinook Salmon characterized as spring-run by the river LDC may actually be fall-run. The race designations should be considered a rough approximation and not interpreted as definitive. Year Range: 1995-2017. Note: Although sampling at Chipps Island started in 1976, this year range was chosen for consistency with the range most recently reported on by DJFMP staff.

Metric Used: The CDFW Fisheries Branch Anadromous Resource Assessment Unit compiles annual population estimates of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the Sacramento San Joaquin River system. The GrandTab report is a compilation of sources estimating the late-fall, winter, spring, and fall-run Chinook salmon total populations for streams surveyed. Estimates are based on counts of fish entering hatcheries and migrating past dams, carcass surveys, live fish counts, and ground and aerial redd counts. Estimates are provided by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Water Resources, the East Bay Municipal Utilities District, the US Bureau of Reclamation, the Lower Yuba River Management Team, and the Fisheries Foundation of California.

The rotary screw trap is deployed at levee mile 14.5 near the base of the Yolo Bypass Toe Drain and is typically operated from January 1st through June. If the first flush of the system occurs earlier, the screw trap will be deployed in December to capture out-migrating fishes. Trap dimentions are: Length: 22.5 ft, Width: 12 ft, Weight: 1300 lbs, Cone: 8 ft diameter and 9 ft length with 2 ft on each end for shaft (total of 13 ft), Livebox: 4 ft by 5 ft with a 25 ft3 volume. During high flows and periods of high debris, the trap may be set intermittently through-out the day, or not set if the high flow becomes a safety concern. The trap is checked daily and upon checking or pulling the trap fish are then collected using dipnets and transferred to separate buckets. Each fish is identified, counted, and then fork length to the nearest millimeter is measured for up to 20-50 individuals of each species. Year Range: 1998 - 2018 Stations: 1 Additional Information: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.233.2 Delta Smelt, Striped Bass, Longfin Smelt, American Shad: Fall Midwater Trawl (Fall Report) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife Metric Used: Annual abundance indices are the sum of the four (September-December) monthly indices, which are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for all 17 areas. The midwater trawl net has mouth dimensions of 12 ft x 12 ft when stretched taught, but mouth dimensions will be smaller when under tension during a tow. Net mesh sizes graduate in nine sections from 8-inch stretch-mesh at the mouth to 0.5-inch stretch-mesh at the cod-end. All four corners of the net mouth are connected to planing doors, which together counteract the drag on net material and hold the net mouth open when being towed through the water. At each station a 12 minute tow is conducted during which the net is retrieved obliquely through the water column from bottom to surface. All fish, shrimp, and jellyfish are identified and enumerated. Year Range: 1967  2017. Note: No sampling in 1974 or 1979. Also, the month range of this survey deviates from the standard September -November definition of fall in this report. It typically takes place September  December. In some years past, however, it started as early as July and/or ended as late as March. Stations: 100 stations are used to calculate the index (out of 122 stations sampled) Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Fall-Midwater-Trawl Data is available on the CDFW File Transfer Protocol Site Adult White Sturgeon: Sturgeon Study (Fall Report) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sturgeon Study Metric Used: Catch per unit effort based on standardized trammel net surveys Year Range: 1967-2017.

The annual index was calculated as the mean of the monthly CPUE values from that year. Year Range: 1976-2018. Stations: 75 stations; see program metadata for site sampling histories. Additional Information: https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm Data is also published on the Environmental Data Initiative Website Delta Smelt: Summer Townet Survey (Summer Report) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife Metric Used: Catches of age-zero Delta Smelt at each index station are weighted by a station-specific weighting factor, summed for all index stations and divided by 1000 to calculate the survey index. The annual index is calculated from the first two survey indices. This method was chosen for consistency with the index calculated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The townet has two sections; the first is made of 1/2\" stretch, knotted, nylon, mesh 6 long, tapering down to an additional 2 fyke. This fyke fits entirely within the second section, a 9 section of woven mesh with approximately 8 holes per inch. Please see the link at right for a diagram of the townet. The entire net measures approximately 15 in total, and is lashed directly to a fixed metal D frame. The D frame is in turn mounted on a 22 pound sled. Two 10 minute stepped oblique tows are performed at each station. At historic stations, a third tow is conducted if any fish are captured during the first two tows. STN enumerates all fishes and several invertebrate species. Fork length is measured to the nearest millimeter for all striped bass, all delta smelt, and the first 50 fish per tow for all other species. Year Range: 1959-2018 Note: The Summer Townet Survey was initiated in 1959, but no index was calculated 1966-1968. Stations: 31 Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey Microcystis (Summer Report) Data Source: Summer Townet Survey and Environmental Monitoring Program Metric Used: Microcystis bloom presence and intensity are measured on a qualitative scale with 5 categories: absent, low (widely scattered colonies), medium (adjacent colonies), high (contiguous colonies), and very high (concentration of contiguous colonies forming mats/scum). (see figure below). Observations were taken at all stations sampled monthly by EMP (see description of EMP sampling under Water Quality, above), and at all stations sampled twice per month by the Summer Townet Survey (see description of Summer Townet, above). Year Range: 2007 - 2018 Stations: 69 Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services/Water-Quality-Monitoring-And-Assessment Figure 158: mean is represented by a dotted red line Aquatic Vegetation (Summer Report) Data Source: Acquired from Shruti Khanna at California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Metric Used: Percent water area occupied by vegetation was estimated from hyperspectral imagery collected once per year. This metric was calculated for each of the two types of vegetation, floating and submerged, by dividing estimated acres of vegetation by estimated total wetted area of the Delta and multiplying by 100. Note that this is a conservative estimate of submerged aquatic vegetation because this type of vegetation is difficult to capture with remote sensing imagery. Also note that, although this plot is included in the summer report, the data were collected during most years in fall when vegetation biomass is at a maximum in the Delta. Year Range: 2004-2018. For 2005-2007, vegetation coverage estimates are available but were not included in the plot because they are undergoing re-processing to better match methodologies used for the rest of the time series. No data were collected 2009-2013. These surveys have been funded in a piecemeal fashion and are not part of any agencys formal monitoring program. Stations: The coverage estimates included in the plot are based on an area representing about a third of the full legal delta, including parts of the Central and North Delta. These regions have been monitored because they represent important habitat for endangered delta smelt. The region for the Central Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Twitchell Island to the southern extent of Rhode Island in the north-south orientation and from the western extent of Sherman Island to eastern extent of Fourteen-Mile Slough in the east-west orientation. The region for the North Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Liberty Island to the southern extent of Prospect Island in the north-south orientation and the western extents of Lindsey Slough to the eastern extent of Prospect Island.
