# Summer Report {#Summer}

#### Interagency Ecological Program Summer Season Report

This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for June through August from 1966 to 2019.

<h2>Delta Outflow</h2>

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="mean is represented by a dotted red line"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_root_static,"mline.png"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="average summer Delta outflow",}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_root_summer,"summer_outflow_update.png"))
```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Summer flow is driven primarily upstream dam releases and exports.
- The summer of 2019 had slightly higher outflow than average.

## Summer Secchi Depth 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Summer Water Temperature 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297). 
* High temperature can increase productivity and may trigger harmful algal blooms.
* Increasing Summer temperatures may limit juvenile smelt survival.
* Summer temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

## Summer Chlorophyll

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the summer.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam *Potamocorbula amurensis* caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Summer Zooplankton

### Background

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}

* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in summer tends to be the highest of the year, particularly for the calanoid copepod *Pseudodiaptomous forbesi*.

## Summer Fish 

### Background

* Delta Smelt, listed as threatened by the Endangered Species Act, have been tracked by [CDFW’s Townet Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey) since 1959 in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and the Delta. 
* Northern Anchovy are an important forage fish in the brackish-saline regions of the estuary. They are sampled best by [CDFW’s San Francisco Bay Study](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study).
* Sacramento Pikeminnow is a native cyprinid that is one of the few piscivorous native fish in the Delta. They are sampled by [USFWS's DJFMP](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm) beach seine surveys throughout the estuary.

## Recent Trends: Summer 2004-2019 

### Background

* Delta Smelt have been in severe decline over the past two decades, with a [Summer Townet Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey)  index of zero in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019.
* *Microcystis* is a toxic cyanobacteria first found in the Delta in 1998. *Microcystis* presence has been documented by the [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) and the  [CDFW Summer Townet Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey) during their water quality sampling.
* Aquatic vegetation in the Delta has increased significantly in recent years. This vegetation is composed mostly of non-native invasive plant species and is categorized as either floating or submerged types. Coverage is estimated by [UC-Davis](http://cstars.metro.ucdavis.edu/) using remote sensing of the North and Central Delta.
