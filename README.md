# Seasonal Monitoring Report

Most of the data is accessible online; see the [Metadata](https://interagencyecologicalprogram.github.io/Status-and-Trends/metadata.html) section of the report or the data acess scripts. 

# smonitr R package:

The [smonitr R package](https://github.com/InteragencyEcologicalProgram/smonitr) is a group of R functions used to standardize the formatting and elements of the plots in the Seasonal Monitoring Report. Files for this package are stored within its own `smonitr` GitHub repository, and installation instructions are provided in its README file.
