# Winter Report {#Winter}


#### Interagency Ecological Program Winter Season Report
This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for September through November of 1966 to 2018.

<h2>Winter Delta Outflow</h2>

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_root_winter,"winter_outflow_update.png"))
```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Winter flow is driven primarily by rainfall and upstream dam releases.
- The winter of 2018 had lower outflow than average.

## Winter Secchi Depth 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Winter Water Temperature 



:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297). 
* Productivity, fish growth, and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges.
* Increasing winter temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction and allow invasive aquatic plants to survive the winter.
* Winter temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

## Winter Chlorophyll

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the winter.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam *Potamocorbula amurensis* caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Winter Zooplankton

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling during the winter did not begin until 1995. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in winter tends to be the lowest of the year.

## Winter Fish 

### Background

* White sturgeon support a recreational fishery. Juvenile sturgeon are sampled by in the [CDFW Bay Study](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study) , which samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta.
* Longfin Smelt are listed as Threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. Spawning adults are sampled in winter by the [CDFW Bay Study](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study) midwater trawl. 
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon are sampled by the [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

## Recent Trends: Winter Fish 2004-2018 

### Background

* Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The [CDFW Spring Kodiak Trawl](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Spring-Kodiak-Trawl) was designed to sample spawning Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta.
* Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so are better sampled by the CDFW Bay Study. The Bay Study samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta.
* Juvenile Chinook pass Red Bluff Diversion Dam on the upper Sacramento as they migrate from spawning grounds to the ocean.
